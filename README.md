# Hey, I'm Blair, but you probably know me as Kwack.

üñ•Ô∏è You'll see me around the development space of TORN a lot, working on any projects I can get my hands on.

I primarily work in Javascript and Typescript, and have a lot of experience with NextJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. 

Send me a message in-game or on Discord if you need a hand with anything, be it your script isn't quite working right or you want to port it to PDA. I'm always around to help out.
